Image Processing:

We found our balls and squares using colour filtering image processing from the
OpenCV library. We have set defaults to look for green and red filters in the
Hue Saturation Value colour spectrum. The two filtered images are added together
using an even weighting. 

A minimum enclosing rectangle is drawn around the biggest found contour. The two 
corners with the minimum y-value are used to find a slope and thus the
orientation of the object that needs to be picked up. 

Cameras:
We used the camera attached to the right hand of Baxter to do the image
processing. First it is orientated at a known fixed position to scout for objects.
Once the biggest object is found, it re-orientates itself above the object. We 
adjusted the number of iterations that baxter used to recheck its position above
the object. Once it finds the object, it calculates the slope and reorientates 
itself to pick the object.
